# Discord Chess Bot

Discord bot that you can play chess against! Currently has 3 simple commands:

- **/newgame** - Creates a new game, you need to input a starting move as white.

- **/move** -  Pretty self-explanatory, plays a move, for example "e2e3".

- **/showboard** - Shows the current position on the board if you hid the previous message on accident.

I did not include stockfish in this repo, you will have to get it yourself from https://stockfishchess.org/download/ and insert the executeable path into the main.py file.
